# Scala-React-Chat-App

This project aims to create an example of implementing a Simple Chat Application using `React.Js with typescript` and `Play Framework with Scala`.

This project will use `apache pekko` **typed actors** which will be a learning curve if you are used to using the **non-typed** actors of `apache pekko`

Please read me `README.md` of `api` and `client` folders for instructions and requirements for running the app.
